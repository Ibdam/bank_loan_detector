🏦 Bank Loan Approval Prediction Model
📌 Project Overview

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant data such as income, credit score, loan amount, and other financial indicators.

The main goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data science skills — from data cleaning, EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and deployment preparation.
🚀 Features of the Project

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features)

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand patterns and correlations

✅ Feature Engineering (created meaningful features to improve model performance)

✅ Implemented multiple ML models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

XGBoost

✅ Model Evaluation using confusion matrix, classification report, ROC-AUC, and Precision-Recall curves

✅ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

✅ Model Serialization with Pickle for deployment

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, pickle

Jupyter Notebook for analysis & documentation
📊 Model Performance

Best Model: Logistic Regression (after hyperparameter tuning)

Accuracy: ~62%

Precision & Recall: Balanced after resampling techniques

ROC-AUC: 0.70 (approx)

Note: Performance may vary depending on dataset quality and preprocessing choices.

📈 Visualizations

Loan approval vs. income distribution

Correlation heatmap of financial features

Confusion matrix for model evaluation

ROC and Precision-Recall curves

🔮 Next Steps

Deploy model as a Flask / FastAPI API

Build a Streamlit dashboard for loan officers to test the model interactively

Improve model accuracy with advanced techniques (SMOTE, ensemble learning)
